# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis

The project is the result of collaborative work between Jahir Miah and Mate Pocs. 

The analysis is based on the data published with this article:

collected guest list from 2015 - 2017, in two hotels in Portugal, anonym
`H1.csv` and `H2.csv` are downloaded from the link above.

The question we want to answer: how accurately can we predict whether a guest will cancel the reservation. We concentrate on the first hotel, H1 in the database. 
<br>

Business case: roughly 25% of the reservations were cancelled, cost to the hotel, makes financial predictions unreliable. The data is complicated enough that simple exploratory data analysis cannot unveil all the connections.
